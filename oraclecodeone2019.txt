Create Your Own Language on JVM with ANTLR and Truffle

Abstract (limit 750 characters)
Would you like to create your own programming language and run its code on JVM? Generally there are many things to do. For example, we need a compiler and a runtime etc. With Truffle, we can easily create and run a new programming language on JVM. Truffle is a language implementation framework and an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) interpreter. Truffle is included in GraalVM. So GraalVM can run various languages such as Ruby, Python, R etc. because those are implemented with Truffle. So all we have to do is creating an AST with Truffle. Additionally we'll use ANTLR, a parse generator library, to create an AST from our source code. After this session, you can create your own language with ANTLR and Truffle!

I'd like to let an audience know that it's easy to create a new programming language with the use of ANTLR and Truffle. I've already written a sample language that can perform the four basic arithmetic operations on GitHub (https://github.com/jyukutyo/JVM-Math-Language). I'm going to add function call functionality later. I've already had a similar session at Japan Java User Group conference. Here is the slide (Japanese): https://www.slideshare.net/jyukutyo/jjug-ccc-2017-fall-jvm. I'll explain about lexer, parser, BNF, AST and Trffle DSL API. Additionally, I'll introduce Graal JIT compiler to give a description of performance improvements provided by Graal for my new language. That is one of the advantages when we create a new language on JVM. The audience will understand the power of Truffle and JVM after this session.

Title (limit 80 characters)
10 Years of My Own Java User Group

Abstract (limit 750 characters)
10 years ago, I don't have any Java user groups around. So I decide to start my own JUG. To be honest, I didn't even know the word "JUG" at that time. Simply I wanted to talk about Java with developers. After 10 years, we have 900+ members in our group and hold an event monthly. I, myself, was able to become a Java champion. Of course it's hard to start a JUG, but it's harder to continue the JUG over the decade. In this session, I will talk about various topics related to operating a JUG, such as the meaning of JUG, the purpose of holding meetings and how to decide on presenters. For these past 10 years, there were a lot of hard times but there were a lot of fun times too. After this session, your passions for JUG will get stronger!

I will encourage people who don't have any JUGs around to start a JUG. There are many JUGs all over the world, but many local cities don't have a JUG yet. At the same time, I want existing JUG members to know it isn't easy to operate a JUG and want them to cooperate more with the their JUG. Only thing that I did to start my JUG was just posting the blog entry "I want to start a JUG!". A few people commented to the post, so I was able to start my JUG with the people. For these past 10 years, the board members changed on several times, but the JUG still continue. I got many things from the JUG, such as friends, technical skills, a broad vision etc. 10 years ago, I was an ordinary Java developer but was able to become a Java champion last year. Having a JUG for a long time makes all the people who get involved the JUG happier, not only a JUG leader like me. I'd like to inform the audience of that.
