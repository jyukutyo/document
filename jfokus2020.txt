Misunderstandings about Java Performance
There are various misunderstandings about Java performance in many web pages and blog posts. Do we need to use StringBuilder class instead of '+' operator? How about basic for statement and enhanced for statement? In Java, micro-benchmark basically doesn't make sense because Java has JIT compilers. The JIT compiler compiles Java bytecode into machine code for the runtime platform. The JIT compiler gathers profile information like method invocation counts, branching count and so on. So the JIT compiler can generate faster machine code with the profile information. This session explains how to measure the performance of Java code with JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) and see machine code that is generated by the JIT compiler with JITWatch.
