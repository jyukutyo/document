Japan JUG, is Kansai Java Engineer Group (KanJava), leader and founder. Web application developer at FURYU CORPORATION in Kyoto, Japan. He has used Java for over ten years. He wrote books about Spring Framework in Japanese and translated many InfoQ articles into Japanese.

Our web application has one billion face image files of young Japanese women. These are photos take in Photo Booth and are send to our application through internet. We use Java, Spring Framework, MogileFS, is open source distributed filesystem to store images, and Oracle RAC. We didn't think that our application had so many images when we started developing. I will explain our architecture, especially about use case of MogileFS and troubles we met. And I also will introduce Japanese "kawaii" cultrure. "kawaii" means "lovable", "cute" or "adorable" and the quality of cuteness in the context of Japanese culture. Many Japanese young women take photos in Photo Booth to become more "kawaii".
